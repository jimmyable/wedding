            <h3>The proposal</h3>
            <p>
                With the determination to make Nikhita his forever, Jimmy embarked on a mission. He enlisted the help of his parents and sister to choose the perfect ring. Having discreetly learned her ring size from their previous promise rings, he was ready for the real proposal.

                Jimmy decided to surprise Nikhita with a touch of humor. He hid the engagement ring inside a candy ring wrapper, hoping to catch her off guard. Though the joke didn't exactly amuse Nikhita, she played along with a smile.
                
                One fateful night, the couple ventured up to Jebel Jais, the highest peak in the UAE, to gaze at the majestic mountains and the star-studded sky. The atmosphere was perfect, the air crisp and clear, and the stars shone brilliantly.
                
                Under the canopy of a billion stars, Jimmy couldn't wait any longer. With a touch of nervousness and a heart full of love, he reached into his pocket and presented Nikhita with the candy ring wrapper. As she opened it, her eyes widened with astonishment and joy as the real engagement ring was revealed.
                
                In the serene silence of Jebel Jais, Jimmy asked the most important question of his life, "Will you marry me?" Holding her breath for a moment, Nikhita's eyes sparkled with tears of happiness as she said yes.
                
                With the stars above as witnesses, they sealed their love at that breathtaking moment. The rest of the night was spent wrapped in each other's arms, watching the stars twinkle above, knowing that their love was as infinite as the universe itself.
