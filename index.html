                Two hearts, Scotland and Dubai's embrace,
                Jimmy and Nikhita, in love's tender chase.
                In Kerala's sanctum, vows they'll exchange,
                From 'me' to 'we,' their lives rearrange.

              Across the miles, their hearts forever true.
              Separated by distance, their longing strong,
              Wishing for moments where they both belong.

                In the UK's embrace, a civil affair so sweet,
                With family close by, their hearts did meet.
                Their journey together, a story just begun,
                Awaiting the grand Indian wedding, the ultimate one.
                
                A small and personal start, in love's warm glow,
                As they wait for the grand celebration to grow.
                Their love's a treasure, forever to bind,
                In both worlds, their hearts intertwined.

            <p>
                
With hearts aflame, a mission set in motion,
Jimmy, devoted, a love-filled ocean.
With family's aid, the perfect ring did gleam,
In a candy wrapper, like a cherished dream.

At Jebel Jais, where stars held their own parade,
Beneath celestial light, their love displayed.
With nerves and love, in a candy's disguise,
Jimmy revealed the truth, a sweet surprise.

Amidst a billion stars, their moment profound,
Jimmy asked, with hope and love unbound,
"Will you marry me?" in the silent night,
Nikhita's joyful tears, a resplendent sight.

Under the cosmic dome, their love did bloom,
As stars above witnessed their love's grand plume.
Wrapped in each other's arms, love's gentle call,
Infinite as the universe, they embraced it all.
