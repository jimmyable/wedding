            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Jimmy was a Southern California boy who ran cross-country, attended
              an all-boys Catholic high school (shenanigans ensued), and
              perfected his image as the “chill smart guy”.  Nikhita was a
              Midwestern girl, a dancer, musician, and hopeful writer who
              embodied every stereotype of the over-achiever.  A pair of
              acceptance letters brought them together to that special place
              between the foothills and the bay – Stanford University.  But they
               didn’t meet until nearly a year later, when Nikhita’s Indian
               dance co-captain and Jimmy’ then-roommate introduced them. Love
               at first sight it was not, but after a rocky start Jimmy
               realized that this girl was too special to let go.  Nikhita,
               being the precocious person she is, had long since come to the
               same conclusion. They happily embarked on the adventure known
               commonly as The College Relationship.

            <h3>The college years</h3>
            <p>
              As they progressed through their college years, Jimmy studying
              computer science and Nikhita the Classics, they grew up together.
              They reveled in their mutual silliness, embraced each others’
              friends as their own, and danced late into the night at parties
              Jimmy would DJ.  They faced the typical challenges – Nikhita
              studying abroad in Athens, Jimmy working long hours on
              computer-sciencey projects - but they found that facing them
              together was more fun than going at it alone. By graduation,
              they were inseparable. After getting their diplomas, Jimmy dove
              into the startup world of Silicon Valley while Nikhita finally
              faced the fact that she could no longer rebel against her dreams
              to be a doctor.  They lived happily side-by-side and explored the
              Bay Area, which they both came to love.  All was well.

            <h3>The big move</h3>
            <p>
              Then Nikhita got into medical school – in Chicago.  Jimmy, being
              the true Californian that he is, barely knew where Chicago was.
              So when Nikhita suggested they continue their relationship
              long-distance, he unknowingly acquiesced.  How hard could it be?
              He soon discovered that Chicago was indeed a great distance away,
              but neither the distance (nor the cold) stopped him from visiting
              Nikhita as she buried herself in medical school at UIC. After 2½
              years of flying back and forth (oh the miles!), Jimmy finally took
               the plunge and moved to Chicago to be with his girl.  Slowly but
               surely, they built a life together in Chicago – exploring the
               city’s amazing restaurants, running through Millenium Park, and
               investing in Jimmy’ first winter coat. Soon enough, Chicago felt
               like a second home.

            <h3>The proposal</h3>
            <p>
              Jimmy decided he wanted to propose to Nikhita soon after he moved
              to Chicago.  He decided to propose where their relationship began
              – at their 5-year Stanford reunion. With the help of his parents,
              he chose a ring on a family trip to Hong Kong and hid it in his
              closet for months. He coordinated with Nikhita’s girlfriends to
              come up with the perfect proposal. True to form, Nikhita repeatedly
              changed her plans that weekend, forcing Jimmy to adjust and
              re-adjust his proposal. On the final morning of reunion weekend,
              Nikhita set out on foot to meet a friend at the Oval to take some
              engagement pictures for her and her new fiancé (the latest ruse).
              Little did she know that her friends were waiting around the
              corner to whisk Jimmy over to the Oval by car.  Nikhita obliviously
              walked to the Oval, where she found Jimmy waiting for her.  Jimmy
              nervously rushed through his speech, maneuvering Nikhita around the
              crowd of tourists that had suddenly appeared, and got down on one
              knee. Nikhita started blubbering, but made sure to say an audible
              “yes” before he slipped the ring on her finger.  Nikhita’s friends
              poured out of their cars, where they had been surreptitiously
              recording the whole event on their phones. And, just like that,
              they started the countdown to #BacligVashi2016.
